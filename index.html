        <h2>Thanks for interacting with me!</h2>
        <p>It's great to meet you! I'm the menace cosplaying as Neco Arc (the one with the huge head). I'm not a big cosplayer or anything so I don't have much of an online presence, I'm afraid. This is actually my first time making a cosplaying and attending a con like this.</p>

        <h2>I'd love it if you could send me the photos/videos you took with me!</h2>
        <p>I created this page as a landing page to keep in touch. If you took photos with me, I'd love to add them to my collection. I don't have opposable thumbs so I can't take any myself. You can reach me at any of the following, though Discord is most convenient:</p>
        <p>Discord: beadybiddle#7582</p>
        <p>Reddit: u/beadybiddle</p>
        <p>Instagram: @beadybiddle</p>
        <p>Twitter: @beadybiddle</p>
        
        <h2>I'm social media illiterate!</h2>
        <p>If you happen to come across any photos or content featuring me online, I'd appreciate if you share it with me! I'm not savvy enough to find it all on my own but I know there are some funny videos floating around the web and I wanna download them all.</p>
